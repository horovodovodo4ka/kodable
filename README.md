Reflectionless simple json serialization/deserialization library for **kotlin-jvm**

## Features:

- Generated code does not use any kind of reflection in runtime
- It's fast in runtime, very fast
- Compile time check for kodables - if there is no kodable for type
  we'll get exception while compilation
- no type erasure in runtime - all kodables called directly without any runtime registry, can pass kodables as arguments anywhere
- simple way for getting kodable for list of elements

## Limitations:

- Kodable doesn't support default values, only nullability - if property
  is not exists in json object it becomes **null**.
- Kodable does not support generics, wildcards etc. Only `List<{Type}>` and `Map<String, {Type}>`
  including nested lists and maps. Used for present json arrays and dictionaries.
- Kodable does not support nullability in that collections.
  
## Installation
Add this dependencies to your `build.grale(.kts)`:
```groovy
kapt("pro.horovodovodo4ka.kodable:processor:2.1.4")
implementation("pro.horovodovodo4ka.kodable:core:2.1.4")
```

If you use library with Android Studio and IDE doesn't allow you use generated code, try to add this:
```groovy
android {
    sourceSets {
        main {
            java.srcDirs += [file("$buildDir/generated/source/kaptKotlin/debug")]
            // file("$buildDir/generated/source/kaptKotlin/release")
        }
    }
}
```

## Usage
Library gives two abilities to deal with json:

- autogenerated code
- manually write custom coders/decoder

### Autogenerated code
Simplest and fastest way - just annotate classes or it's constructors and voila!

`@Koder` generates both encoder and decoder, used for data classes and
enums.

`@Dekoder` generates **decoder** for trivial classes

`@Enkoder` generates **encoder** for trivial classes - can be applied
only for inner classes of types needed to be encoded.

### Data classes

```kotlin
@Koder
data class User(
    val name: String, // required property in json

    // This annotation says that in json property name is differ from kotlin class property
    @KodableName("surname")
    // nullable types are optional in json - there will not be exception if property is not decoded, it just sets to null
    val givenName: String?
)
```
Simplest case - Kodable generates decoder and encoder for all properties
in primary constructor. That it simple!

So now we can use generated *kodable*
```kotlin
val kodable = User::class.kodable()
val user = kodable.dekode(""" { "name": "John" } """)
// user.name = "John"
// user.givenName = null
```

### Enums
```kotlin
@Koder
enum class Gender {
    // If enum can not be decoded from json than uses that value.
    // If default is not specified than json decoding is failed with exception
    @Default
    unspecified,
    male,
    female;
}
```
Just assumes that enum's value name is equal to json enum value and
presented as string.

```kotlin
val female = Gender::class.kodable().dekode(""" "female" """)
// female = Gender.female
val unknown = Gender::class.kodable().dekode(""" "aaaaaa!!!" """)
// unknown = Gender.unspecified
```

### Trivial classes

```kotlin
@Dekoder
class User(name: String, givenName: String?)
```

In this example Kodable takes first constructor in class and uses it's
signature as Json fields description.

You are able use `val/var` in constructor if it's primary same as with
data classes.
```kotlin
@Dekoder
class User(val name: String,  @KodableName("surname") val givenName: String?, gender: Gender?)
// Last parameter is not `val/var` so it will be decoded from json but you must deal with it by yourself
```

If not using data class style primary constructor, than you can emulate
default values for example or do something else
```kotlin
@Dekoder
class User(val name: String?, @KodableName("surname") givenName: String?) {
    val givenName: String = givenName ?: "Doe"
}
```

You also can annotate not class itself but it's any constructor.
```kotlin
class User {
    val name: String
    val givenName: String

    constructor (name: String, givenName: String?) {
        this.name = name
        this.givenName = givenName
    }

    @Dekoder
    constructor(fullName: String?) {
        // splitting full name and assign name and givenName
        // ...
    }
}
```

Decoding of trivial classes is much more tricky: you must create inner
class and all properties of it will be encoded to json. All properties
names **are** json properties names in json object:
```kotlin
@Dekoder
class User(val name: String?, @KodableName("surname") givenName: String?) {
    val givenName: String = givenName ?: "Doe"

    // this field we don't want to encode
    var gender = Gender.unspecified

    @Enkoder
    // this class must have empty constructor! Others are not prohibited, but not used
    inner class Out {
        val name = this@User.name
        val surname = this@User.givenName
    }
}
```

This is tricky but gives total control over
serialization/deserialization, even asymmetrical.

### External classes
Often you need use external classes (`java.util.Date` as example or
third party library classes) in your models and you can't modify and
annotate that classes.

You have two options: use annotation
`@CustomKodable` for specific field/property/constructor parameter or
use `@DefaultKodableForType` annotation - mark with it your own kodable
realization and it will be used as default.

You can combine this methods - define default kodable, but sometimes use
another for specific properties.

Example - we define that all dates are ISO8601 in json:
```kotlin
@DefaultKodableForType(Date::class)
object DateKodable : IKodable<Date> {
    private val formatter = SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ", Locale.ENGLISH)
    override fun readValue(reader: JsonReader): Date = formatter.parse(reader.readString())
    override fun writeValue(writer: JsonWriter, instance: Date) = writer.writeString(formatter.format(instance))
}
```
**Important note: such kodables must be `object`s**

Example of `@CustomKodable`
```kotlin
@Koder
data class Event(val caption: String, @CustomKodable(DateKodable::class) val startDate: Date)
```

Note: you can use `@CustomKodable` also for overriding **ANY** default
kodables including generated and even for primitive types

### Collections
Just use kodable's property `list` to get kodable for list of elements of given type
```kotlin
val userList: List<User> = User::class.kodable().list.dekode("""[{"name": "Alice"},{"name": "Bob"}]""")
```
Also homogeneous (properties values has same type) JSON objects can be decoded to (or encoded from) Map<String, {Type}> with `dictionary` kodable:
```kotlin
val links: List<String, URL> = URL::class.kodable().dictionary.dekode("""{"Google Inc.": "https://google.com", "Wikipedia": "https://wikipedia.org"}""")
```

### Advanced usage
Sometimes data for decoding is nested in some JSON entities.
To decode them we need define nesting entities and get sub entity from them. It's boring:
```json
{
  "data": {
      "user": {
          "name": "Alice"
        }
    }
}
```
leads to
```kotlin
@Dekoder
class UserWrapper(val user: User)

@Dekoder
class DataWrapper(val data: UserWrapper)
```
For use with other model more wrappers needed :-(

So! Kodable has special class `KodablePath` describing such nesting - when model is decoded Kodable tries move forward to nested element and then decodes needed model (User in example above)

```kotlin
User::class.kodable().dekode("...", KodablePath(".data.user"))
```
That's it.
Notation is simple: object's properties are accessed via `.<property_name>` and collections elements are accessed via `[<index_in_collection>]`

Samples of paths:
```kotlin
".data.user"
".data.items[0]"
"[2]" // in that case root element is JSON array
"data" // root dot can be ommitted
```

### Polymorphic cases
Sometimes also needed to encode/decode model based on their types - they are all childs of base abstraction and should be encoded/decoded with it as anchor. 
In JSON, typically, it looks like:
```
[ 
    {
        "i" : 10, 
        "poly_type" : "p1"
    },
    {
        "poly_type" : "p2",
        "s" : "yay!"
    }
]
```
Here two objects which types marked with `poly_type` field. Here that types in code:
```kotlin
interface Poly

@Koder
data class P1(val i: Int) : Poly

@Koder
data class P2(val s: String) : Poly
```
As you see - both has supertype `Poly`. So let's make `Poly` able to be decoded and/or encoded:
```kotlin
@DefaultKodableForType(Poly::class)
object PolySerializer : IKodable<Poly> by poly({
    propType("poly_type")
    P1::class named "p1" with P1Kodable
    P2::class named "p2" with P2Kodable
})
```
With this DSL we defines that `Poly` can be represented with two types `P1` and `P2` tagged (via field `poly_type`) with "p1" and "p2" accordingly. Other fields in json are their's own.

If you expect that somewhen can be decoded not defined type you can use fallback:
```kotlin
interface Poly

object UndefinedPoly: Poly

@Koder
data class P1(val i: Int) : Poly

@Koder
data class P2(val s: String) : Poly

@DefaultKodableForType(Poly::class)
object PolySerializer : IKodable<Poly> by poly({
    propType("poly_type")
    P1::class named "p1" with P1Kodable
    P2::class named "p2" with P2Kodable
    withFallback(UndefinedPoly) // default
})
```

## TODO
- [x] add documentation for KodablePath - helper for skip to subelements
      without describing dummy models
- [x] maps as collections additionally to `List`
- [ ] polymorphysm for sealed classes
- [x] polymorphysm for trivial classes
- [ ] more strong type cheking in compile time
- [ ] simplify enkoders for trivial classes
